    Explore! La Fortuna and Arenal Volcano, Monteverde Cloud Forest, Manuel Antonio National Park, and the beaches of the Pacific Coast should all be included in a Costa Rican itinerary for 7 days.

    description: "One of the most popular 7-day Peru itineraries takes you on the famous Inca Trail, high in the Andes mountains. Beginning and ending in the colonial city of Cusco, the Inca Trail express route is perfect for experienced and novice trekkers alike and offers the chance to visit the mighty Machu Picchu. Youâ€™ll hike through the Sacred Valley, travel through Ollantaytambo, and retrace the steps of the Inca people. After multiple days of hiking youâ€™ll be rewarded with one of the Seven Wonders of the World; Machu Picchu! This Incan citadel sits high in the mountains and dates back to the 15th century.  At the end of your trip, spend a day exploring Cusco, South Americaâ€™s oldest continuously inhabited city.
    Alternatively, spend seven days exploring Northern Peru. Starting and ending in the capital of Lima youâ€™ll unlock the secrets of the Andes as you visit the majestic Gocta Falls, Quiocta Caves, and the ruined fortress of Kuelap. Youâ€™ll have time to explore Lima on day one and day seven of this trip.",
